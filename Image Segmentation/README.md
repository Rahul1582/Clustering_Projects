# Image Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Image segmentation is an important step in image processing, and it seems everywhere if we want to analyze whatâ€™s inside the image.

Image segmentation is the classification of an image into different groups. Many kinds of research have been done in the area of image segmentation using clustering. There are different methods and one of the most popular methods is K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Screenshots(Output)

#### Original Image-

<img src ="img.jpg"  width=800 height=500>
<br>


#### After applying clustering on the image-

<img src ="test.PNG"  width=800 height=530>
<br>

This consists 8 photos starting from top left K=1 to K=8. 

For different K we got different clusters.
