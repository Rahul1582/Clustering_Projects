# Document Segmentation Using Mini Batch K-Means Clustering

Clustering documents is an important task as it groups similar documents together which can be used for a variety of tasks such as recommendations, similarity detection, creating dataset of a topic, generate new data following same pattern and so on. 

For this we used Mini Batch K means Clustering Technique..

## Document Clustering vs Topic Modelling

Topic Modeling yields topics present in each document, one can say that topic modeling generates a representation for documents in the topic space. 

As the number of topics is much less than the vocabulary associated with the document collection, the topic space representation can be viewed as a dimensionality reduction process as well. One can use this topic space representation of documents to perform clustering. 

On the other hand, one can analyze the frequency of words in each cluster to determine topic associated with each cluster. With hard clustering, this will yield only one topic associated with each document. 

On the other hand, using clustering will allow multiple topics associated with each document similar to the result obtained via topic modeling. 

Thus Topic modeling and Document clustering are much similar to each other, the difference being how the problem is being approach.
